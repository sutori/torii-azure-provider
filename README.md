# Ember CLI Torii Azure Provider (ECTAP) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/ghurlman/torii-azure-provider/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/ghurlman/torii-azure-provider)

### TLDR

ECTAP is an Azure authentication provider for Torii, rolled up as an EmberCLI addon.

### Usage

In order to use ECTAP, you'll need an Ember CLI app (if you already have one, skip this):

```
$ ember new my-new-app
```

Then, add Torii and ECTAP to your project:

```
$ ember install torii
$ ember install ember-cli-torii-azure-provider
```

Now, edit `/config/environment.js` to add your Torii provider configuration, placing your Azure Client ID in the designated spot. If you need help creating an Azure app and getting that ID, [follow MSDN guidance](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn132599.aspx#BKMK_Adding):

```
module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {

  // ... other ENV config stuff here

   ENV['torii'] = {
      providers: {
        'azure-oauth2': {
          apiKey: 'AZURE APP CLIENT ID GOES HERE',
          redirect_uri: "APP URI GOES HERE",
          state: "STATE" // For CSRF, should be random & unguessable
        }
      }
    }

  return ENV;
};
```

With that, you *should* be good to go. For an example of how to use this with [Ember Simple Auth](http://ember-simple-auth.com/), check out [the sample app for ECTAP](https://github.com/ghurlman/torii-azure-auth-sample).
